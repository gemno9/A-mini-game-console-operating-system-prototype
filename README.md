# A mini game console operating system kernel prototype
This operating system is imitated from the "mine" operating system made by Tian Yu.I made a simple game console operating system kernel based on it, and added a game I made myself.
## How to compile it?
Under the compiling environment of Linux.  
My environment:Centos 7.
## What is the final result of compilation?
"kernel.bin"
## How to use it?
1.Make a USB flash disk for UEFI boot（shell.efi,boot.efi is ready for you."shell.efi" and "boot.efi" is made by Tian Yu.）

2.Insert the USB flash disk into the system and type the following command on the console(Suppose these files are on your desktop:shell.efi,boot.efi,kernel.bin):

command1:  
mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/  
mkdir -p /mnt/EFI/BOOT  
cp Desktop/Shell.efi /mnt/EFI/BOOT/BOOTx64.EFI  
sync  
umount /mnt/  

command2:  
mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/  
mkdir -p /mnt/EFI/BOOT  
cp Desktop/boot.efi /mnt/  
cp Desktop/kernel.bin /mnt/  
sync  
umount /mnt/
